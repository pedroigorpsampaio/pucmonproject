A pervasive game using ContextNet middleware from LAC (Laboratory for Advanced Collaboration). 
This is the result of a collaboration between LAC and ICAD/VisionLab (Laboratory of Visualization, Digital TV/Cinema, and Games) from PUC-Rio.

This repository is shared with the goal of aiding future similar projects. For a guide on how to setup the environment
with the components used in this project (ContextNet, LibGDX, AndroidStudio...) please refer to the Guide.pdf file in the
