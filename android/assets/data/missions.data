-- Missions Data File
-- README PLEASE!
-- Contains missions that will be available in game
-- To use spaces in identifiers use underline "_" (see examples below)
-- Pay attention in the provided examples and commentaries. Mimic them.
-- Mission name and description should be created in language bundle property files
-- Their names must be the same one here and in enum concatenated with "_Name" for names
-- and "_Desc" for description. See provided examples in property file and mimic them.
