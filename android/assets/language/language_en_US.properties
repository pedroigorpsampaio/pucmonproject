                      you get your reward. Part of this research is about Participatory Sensing, where \
                      citizens help society with sensing tasks, by sharing their bandwidth collecting sensor \
                      data as well as providing data that is hard to gather only through sensors. \
                      In this last mission, we ask you to contribute by rating the bathroom regarding its \
                      basic services. We thank you so much for participating on this experiment!

                      inside a book that is in the University Library. To get access to the book, you must first\
                      discover the author that is subject of the book. Here is a hint: the name of the author is Joaquim,\
                      he was born in Rio de Janeiro, in 1839, and wrote about Bras\u00E1 and Quincas. Once you have\
                      access to the book, you will have to find the secret word. Here is a hint to find it: p93pr6pa3
